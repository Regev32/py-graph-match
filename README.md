Matching with Graph

`grma` is a package for finding HLA matches using graphs approach.
The matching is based on [grim's](https://github.com/nmdp-bioinformatics/py-graph-imputation) imputation.


## Pre-requisites

### Data Directory Structure

```
data
├── donors_dir
│   └── donors.txt
├── hpf.csv
└── patients.txt
```

### conf Directory Structure

```
conf
└── minimal-configuration.json
```

Follow these steps for finding matches:

Setup a virtual environment (venv) and run:
```
make install
```

## Quick Getting Started

Get Started with a built-in example.

### Build 'Donors Graph'

```
python test_build_donors_graph.py
```

### Find Matches

Use grma algorthm for finding matches efficiently. You can run the file `test_matching.py`
```
python test_matching.py
```

Find the match results in `results` directory.

# Full Walk through
### Building The Donors' Graph:

The donors' graph is a graph which contains all the donors (the search space). It implemented using a LOL (List of Lists) representation written in cython for better time and memory efficiency.
The building might take a lot of memory and time, so it's recommended to save the graph in a pickle file.

Before building the donors' graph, all the donors' HLAs must be imputed using `grim`.
Then all the imputation files must be saved under the same directory.

```python
import os
from grma.donorsgraph.build_donors_graph import BuildMatchingGraph

PATH_TO_DONORS_DIR = "data/donors_dir"
PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH = "output/donors_graph.pkl"

os.makedirs(f"output", exist_ok=True)

build_matching = BuildMatchingGraph(PATH_TO_DONORS_DIR)
graph = build_matching.graph  # access the donors' graph

build_matching.to_pickle(PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH)  # save the donors' graph to pickle
```

### Search & Match before imputation to patients
The function `matching` finds matches up to 3 mismatches and return a `pandas.DataFrame` object of the matches sorted by number of mismatches and their score.

The function get these parameters:
* match_graph: a grma donors' graph object - `grma.match.Graph`
* grim_config_file: a path to `grim` configuration file


```python
from grma.match import Graph, matching

PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH = "output/donors_graph.pkl"
PATH_CONGIF_FILE = "conf/minimal-configuration.json"


# The donors' graph we built earlier
donors_graph = Graph.from_pickle(PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH)


# matching_results is a dict - {patient_id: the patient's result dataframe}
matching_results = matching(donors_graph,PATH_CONGIF_FILE, search_id=1, donors_info=[],
                                    threshold=0.1, cutoff=100, save_to_csv=True, output_dir="results")

```

`matching` takes some optional parameters, which you might want to change:

* search_id: An integer identification of the search. default is 0.
* donors_info: An iterable of fields from the database to include in the results. default is None.
* threshold: Minimal score value for a valid match. default is 0.1.
* cutof: Maximum number of matches to return. default is 50.
* verbose: A boolean flag for whether to print the documentation. default is False
* save_to_csv: A boolean flag for whether to save the matching results into a csv file. default is False.  If the field is set to True, upon completion of the function, it will generate a directory named `search_1`
* `output_dir`: output directory to write match results file to

### Search & Match after imputation to patients

The function `find_mathces` find matches up to 3 mismatches and return a `pandas.DataFrame` object of the matches
 sorted by number of mismatches and their score.

They get these parameters:
* imputation_filename: a path to the file of the patients' typing.
* match_graph: a grma donors' graph object - `grma.match.Graph`

```python
from grma.match import Graph, find_matches

PATH_TO_PATIENTS_FILE = "data/patients_file.txt"
PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH = "output/donors_graph.pkl"

# The donors' graph we built earlier
donors_graph = Graph.from_pickle(PATH_TO_DONORS_GRAPH)
matching_results = find_matches(PATH_TO_PATIENTS_FILE, donors_graph)

# matching_results is a dict - {patient_id: the patient's result dataframe}

for patient, df in matching_results.items():
    # Use here the dataframe 'df' with the results for 'patient'
    print(patient, df)
```

`find_matches` takes some optional parameters, which you might want to change:
* search_id: An integer identification of the search. default is 0.
* donors_info: An iterable of fields from the database to include in the results. default is None.
* threshold: Minimal score value for a valid match. default is 0.1.
* cutof: Maximum number of matches to return. default is 50.
* verbose: A boolean flag for whether to print the documentation. default is False
* save_to_csv: A boolean flag for whether to save the matching results into a csv file. default is False.
If the field is set to True, upon completion of the function, it will generate a directory named `Matching_Result
s_1`.
* calculate_time: A boolean flag for whether to return the matching time for patient. default is False.
  In case `calculate_time=True` the output will be dict like this: `{patient_id: (results_dataframe, time)}`
* `output_dir`: output directory to write match results file to

### Set Database
In order to get in the matching results more information about the donors than the matching information,
one can set a database that has all the donors' information in it.
The database must be a `pandas.DataFrame` that its indexes are the donors' IDs.

After setting the database, when calling one of the matching functions,
you may set in the `donor_info` variable a `list` with the names of the columns you want to join to the result dataframe from the database.

Example of setting the database:

```python
import pandas as pd
from grma.match import set_database

donors = [0, 1, 2]
database = pd.DataFrame([[30], [32], [25]], columns=["Age"], index=donors)

set_database(database)
```

    |-- features
    |   |-- algorithm
    |   |   `-- SLUG\ Match.feature
    |   `-- definition

9. Run all tests with `make test` or different tests with `make behave` or `make pytest`. `make behave` will generate report files and open the browser to the report.
10. Use `python app.py` to run the Flask service app in debug mode. Service will be available at http://localhost:8080/
11. Use `make docker-build` to build a docker image using the current `Dockerfile`.
12. `make docker` will build and run the docker image with the service.  Service will be available at http://localhost:8080/
